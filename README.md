# From Data to Decisions: Data Science for Customer Journey Analytics Lab

Unlock the full potential of Adobe Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) with advanced data science techniques and Python programming. This hands-on lab equips you with the skills to build datasets, optimize integration processes, and leverage powerful analytics tools using Python.\
You'll learn to streamline data ingestion, create efficient workflows, and maximize CJA's capabilities through Python. Our instructors will guide you through practical exercises designed to enhance data quality, improve workflows, and implement advanced analytics using Python libraries. We'll also explore how to use Python to interact with Adobe's APIs for sophisticated data manipulation. This lab empowers you to create scalable, high-performance data architectures that drive actionable insights and business valueâ€”all using Python.

On this repository, you will have access to several notebooks to learn different ways to build and scale efficient analysis and pipeline: 

## Notebook 1 : Introduction to cjapy
In this notebook, get familiar with the concept used in `cjapy` and how to connect to that tool.\
We will provide you information on how to get started with python, cjapy and the required permissions to unlock their potential. 

Covers:
* Creating a Developer Project in Adobe Environemnt
* Installing the cjapy, aepp, notebook module
* Getting started with cjapy

## Notebook 2 : Solution Design & data usage
In this notebook, we will build a Solution Design from scratch using the cjapy in order to learn how to easily build readable meta data file. 
From this extraction, we will identify which elements are being used (or not) and map them to XDM fields so you can report on XDM paths and not on CJA dimensions and metrics.\
This can build a bridge between the data analysts and the data architect to understand the schema composition of the data collection methods.

Covers:
* Connecting to cjapy and retrieving dataviews
* Manipulating, cleaning and copying a dataframe
* Connecting to AEP via aepp
* Extracting Schema information via aepp
* Connecting Schema and Solution design

## Notebook 3 : Advance Analytics
In this notebook, we will provide additional capabilities that can be leveraged by the python ecosystem to bring additional insights in your data.\
Some external libraries can be used to extend the analysis and visualization in order to derive even more value out of your data that have been processed by Customer Journey Analytics.


## Notebook 4 : Ingestion in AEP
In this notebook, we will use the data that are
